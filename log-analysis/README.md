# AIOps for Log Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating **AIOps** (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) implementation for proactive log analysis using **machine learning algorithms**. The project showcases the evolution from traditional reactive log monitoring to **AI-powered anomaly detection**.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Implement AIOps for log analysis using Python

- Compare traditional threshold-based approaches vs. AI-powered anomaly detection

- Demonstrate proactive issue detection in application logs

- Use machine learning for pattern recognition in observability data

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**

- **Pandas**- Data manipulation and analysis

- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning library (Isolation Forest)

- **Collections** - Data counting and processing

- **Regular Expressions** - Log pattern matching

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

```pip install pandas scikit-learn```

**Running the Scripts**

**Traditional Log Analysis:**

```python simple_log_analysis.py```

**AI-Powered Log Analysis:**

```python aiops_log_analysis.py```

## üß† Key Concepts

**Traditional Approach**

- Manual threshold setting

- Reactive error detection

- Limited to known patterns

- Human-defined rules and alerts

**AIOps Approach**

- **Isolation Forest Algorithm**: Unsupervised machine learning for anomaly detection

- **Proactive Detection**: Identifies unknown patterns and anomalies

- **Smart Analysis**: Detects critical issues in INFO/WARNING logs that traditional methods miss

- **Continuous Learning**: Improves accuracy with more data

## üìä Results

The AI-powered approach successfully detected:

- Slow query performance issues (warning level)

- Multiple failed login attempts

- Memory leak patterns

- Response time anomalies

These critical issues were missed by traditional threshold-based monitoring.

## üéì Learning Outcomes

- Understanding AIOps vs. traditional monitoring

- Implementing machine learning for log analysis

- Using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection

- Moving from reactive to proactive monitoring strategies

## üìù Usage Notes

- The Isolation Forest algorithm expects ~10% of logs to be anomalies (configurable)

- Log levels are encoded: INFO=1, WARNING=2, ERROR=3, CRITICAL=4

- Regular expressions filter logs to the expected timestamp-level message format

- Enterprise platforms achieve higher accuracy through training on millions of log entries
