# ai-assisted-devops

Welcome to **AI-Assisted DevOps**, a curated collection of hands-on projects and scripts demonstrating how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can **simplify, automate**, and **enhance** key tasks in the daily workflow of DevOps Engineers.

This repository is part of the broader initiative to bridge the gap between traditional DevOps practices and modern AI-powered solutions.

## 🚀 What This Repository Offers

This repository includes practical, beginner-friendly projects that show how AI can assist DevOps engineers in areas like:

- 📊 Log Analysis

- 🔍 Anomaly Detection

- 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

- 📦 Containerization & Manifest Generation

- 📈 Metric Forecasting & Alerting

- 🧪 Test Case Prioritization

- 🛠️ Incident Management Automation

Each task will have its own folder with:

- ✅ Source code (Python/others)

- 📁 Sample input files/logs

- 📘 Step-by-step explanations

## 🧠 Why AI in DevOps?

Traditional DevOps workflows often involve **manual analysis, static rules**, and **reactive alerts**. AI brings:

- **Proactive anomaly detection**

- **Intelligent alerting** based on historical patterns

- **Predictive insights** for scaling and performance

- **Faster root cause analysis**
  
- **Self-healing automation**

By integrating AI, DevOps can evolve from rule-based automation to **adaptive, learning-driven operations.**

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.7+

- pip

- **Modules**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc. (varies by task)

  To install common dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Each project folder will have its own detailed setup instructions if needed.
